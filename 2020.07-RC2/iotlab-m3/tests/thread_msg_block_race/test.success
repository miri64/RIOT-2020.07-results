main(): This is RIOT! (Version: buildtest)
Test is "successful" if it runs forever without halting
on any of the assertion in this file

I will try to trigger an interrupt at random intervals. When an
interrupt is fired while ISR is disable in the thread_yield_higher()
function some platform-specific implementations used to not call
sched_run() which was the cause of the bug tested here
